# House-Price-Analysis

## Introduction

This project involves analyzing house prices using a dataset containing various attributes of houses sold in Ames, Iowa. The goal is to understand the key factors that influence house prices, focusing on overall quality, condition, and location.

## Hypothesis

**Hypothesis**: **The overall quality and condition of a house, along with its location, significantly influence its sale price.**

## Data Sources

1. **Primary Dataset**:
   - `train.csv`: Contains detailed information on house attributes and sale prices.
   - Source: [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features using Python (Pandas, NumPy).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions, relationships, and trends using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and selecting important features for the model.
- **Machine Learning**: Building predictive models using Python (Scikit-Learn) to predict house prices.
- **Data Visualization**: Presenting findings and insights through visualizations using Tableau.

## Project Structure
